Welcome. My 2026 New Year's resolution is to really learn ML from the ground up — this is where I'm documenting the journey.

Notes + implementations, with all the math. Follow along if you want!

- Start with: **MNIST from Scratch (Backprop, Autodiff, SGD)**
- Then: **Convnets / ResNets**
- Then: **RL**
